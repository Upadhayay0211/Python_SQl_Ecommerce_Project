🛒 Python & SQL Ecommerce Project
📌 About the Project
This project is a hands‑on exploration of an Ecommerce dataset using Python and SQL. The goal is simple: turn raw data into clear business insights that recruiters, collaborators, or hiring managers can quickly understand.

⚙️ Tools Used
Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

SQL: MySQL / SQLite for queries

Jupyter Notebook: for interactive analysis

🔑 What’s Inside
SQL queries answering real business questions (e.g., repeat purchase rates, sales trends).

Python visualizations that make the numbers easy to grasp.

Insights on customer behavior, product performance, and retention challenges.
